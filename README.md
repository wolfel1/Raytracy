# Raytracy

This app is meant to experiment with raytracing and other render techniques.
Currently it supports only Windows. Setup script support Visual Studio 2022 by default.

## Requirements
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com) (not strictly required, however included setup scripts only support this)

## Getting Started
Once you've cloned, run `Win-GenerateProjectVS.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files. Once you've opened the solution, you can run the Sandbox project to see a basic example (code in `App.cpp`).
